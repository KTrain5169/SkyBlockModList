# Contributor's Guide
Thank you for choosing to contribute. By contributing, you improve the repository.
This contributor's guide is here to help you on what to do if you wish to contribute.
# I want to add a mod to the list!
If so, open an [Issue](https://github.com/KTrain5169/SkyBlockModList/issues) describing what the mod is, where to find it, and several notable features/a short description of the mod.
# Something's not right in the list!
[Fork the repo](https://github.com/KTrain5169/SkyBlockModList/fork), make your changes in a separate branch based off `main`, then open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/KTrain5169/SkyBlockModList/pulls) from that branch, requesting it be merged into `main`.
# I want to fix your terrible website design!
First of all, thanks, I'm terrible at designing this stuff.
[Fork the repo](https://github.com/KTrain5169/SkyBlockModList/fork), do whatever you need to, then test your changes by enabling GitHub Pages in your fork's settings. Once you confirm they are what you intended, [Pull Request](https://github.com/KTrain5169/SkyBlockModList/pulls).

Once you're done with that, add your name to the [CREDITS.md](./CREDITS.md) file in the same branch you made your changes on (if applicable).

Thanks again! --signed KTrain
