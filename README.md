If you wish to improve the repo in any way, read the Contributor's guide, then either open an [Issue](https://github.com/KTrain5169/SkyBlockModList/issues) or [Pull Request](https://github.com/KTrain5169/SkyBlockModList/pulls). (and I'll be needing... some... help for this)

To get started, follow these steps, depending on the version of Minecraft you wish to play:
* 1.8.9: [Install Forge for 1.8.9](./docs/1.8.9/forge.md).
* 1.20: [Install Fabric for 1.20](./docs/1.20/fabric.md).

Other options to get started:
* [Install SkyClient](./docs/sc/index.md) (1.8.9 only)
* [Install & setup Prism Launcher](./docs/launcher/prism/index.md)
* [Install & setup Modrinth Launcher](./docs/launcher/mr/index.md)
* [Install & setup ATLauncher](./docs/launcher/at/index.md)
* [About clients/modfolders](./docs/clients/clients_modfolders.md)

Once you're up and ready, you can proceed to either of these pages, again, depending on the version of Minecraft you chose:
* 1.8.9: [See this list for Forge 1.8.9 mods](./docs/1.8.9/mods.md).
* 1.20: [See this list for Fabric 1.20 mods](./docs/1.20/mods.md).
